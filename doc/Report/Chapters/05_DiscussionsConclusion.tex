As you have noticed the final result is under-performing existing models that we have. But the aim of this project was not to create a state of the art embedding model. We believe we have achieved following in this project: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Trying new method for embedding and make sure the basics and pipeline is working 
    \item Having a white-box approach to embedding method 
    \item Building up the ground for next steps for embedding
    \item Make sure our method will work on web-scale dataset and it is feasible on existing processing machines that we have access to. 
\end{itemize}

All of the above targets were met, now it's the time to take further steps. Here are the possible next steps regarding this project: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Explore various combination of hyper parameters (Window size, K , \ldots)
    \item Explore matrices other than PPMI matrix. The suggestion could be to use  Graph Laplacian methods to extract these values
    \item Work on other graph based pre-processing to extend the scope of this work to other areas. 
\end{itemize}
