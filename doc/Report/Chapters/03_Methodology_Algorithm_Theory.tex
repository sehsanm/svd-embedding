In this section we describe a little more technical details of the project that most be considered for successful implementation. 
\subsection{Sparsity}
One of the items that are vital for this project to be successful is to keep the sparsity of the matrixes. The start of the work is from building cooccurrence matrix. And this matrix is sparse by nature. But the way that we implement the code is important as this will significantly will impact the performance of the algorithm. And if not implemented properly it might even make it impossible to run our algorithm in such scale. 

We used python language and utilised \textit{SciPy} library because it supports implementation of sparse matrixes and also sparse algorithms of SVD methods.
